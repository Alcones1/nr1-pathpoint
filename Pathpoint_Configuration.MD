A common starting place for Pathpoint is APM Events and Logs, but it is up to you. The other thing you'll need to know is how this telemetry maps onto the business process you want to model as stages and steps. That may require some internal disucssions with your stakeholders to understand how things really fit in.

When you are ready to make some edits you can simply download the current version of the JSON config, edit and re-upload it. You can also use "right click" to adjust touchpoint configurations.
