The stages of a Pathpoint, allow you to see the business processes at a high level, and for each commercial stage, different services and methods are presented at the system level. Based on business information, PathPoint previews latency indicators. 

And the information related to a particular stage, including the errors for each one of them, can be viewed on REAL TIME at a high level. In each particular stage we can see first-hand if any of its associated touchpoints are critical, and if this is the case, then the stage will turn yellow. If it stays green, it means that everything is working normally. And if instead the stage turns the color red, it means that all its touchpoints have anomalies, that need to be resolved.
